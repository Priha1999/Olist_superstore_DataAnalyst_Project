# Olist_superstore_DataAnalyst_Project
The Olist Store Analysis project involves analyzing key e-commerce metrics to extract meaningful insights from transactional data. This analysis provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior, order processing, and store performance.

1. Weekday vs Weekend Payment Statistics
   
This analysis examines the distribution of purchases based on the day of the week. The goal is to identify payment patterns during weekdays versus weekends, which helps determine peak shopping periods. The analysis is further categorized by payment types, highlighting customer preferences for different payment methods during specific days.

2. Number of Orders with Review Score 5 and Payment Type as Credit Card
   
This task focuses on high-quality customer feedback, specifically examining the number of orders that received a review score of 5 and were paid for using a credit card. This insight helps identify a correlation between payment method and customer satisfaction, enabling strategies to enhance the customer experience.

3. Average Number of Days Taken for Order Delivery (Pet Shop Orders)
   
This analysis calculates the average delivery time for orders in the pet shop category. Understanding delivery times can help optimize logistics and improve delivery efficiency, especially for niche segments like pet products.

4. Average Price and Payment Values from Customers in São Paulo City
   
This analysis identifies the average price and payment values for customers located in São Paulo. By focusing on a specific geographic region, this insight helps tailor marketing and pricing strategies to maximize sales and customer satisfaction in key markets.

5. Relationship Between Shipping Days and Review Scores
    
This analysis explores how the number of shipping days (the time between order placement and delivery) impacts customer review scores. By identifying the relationship between delivery speed and customer satisfaction, the company can work on improving its shipping processes to boost positive reviews.

Additional Features:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Average Payment and others are calculated to provide a quick overview of the store’s performance.

Filters:

Filters are implemented to allow users to drill down into the data, view specific time periods, or analyze particular regions, payment types, and product categories. This interactive feature makes the analysis dynamic and customizable for different business needs.

Insights and Applications:

This project offers actionable insights that can improve business strategies, optimize logistics, enhance customer satisfaction, and refine marketing efforts. By analyzing customer behaviors and performance metrics, Olist can make informed decisions that lead to growth and efficiency improvements.
